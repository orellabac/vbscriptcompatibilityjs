VBScript Compatibility Library for Javascript
============================================

Microsoft has slowly being retiring support for VBScript. 
At this point VBScript is not supported on IE11.

So I tought. Well what happen if you have lots of VBScript and you need help on moving them to Javascript.

So I decided to create a small compatibility library to make the task less stressful.

Current Progress
---------------
9/25/2019
At this point I have implemented 85% of the common VBScript functions and started some validation unit tests.
The tests are still in progress.
Some of the tests fail because VBScript had more accuracy on some operations. 
I still do not know how to handle that so for now those tests will fail

My plans are on finish all the the functions, add documentation and also use some of the common scripts to ease the migration process
