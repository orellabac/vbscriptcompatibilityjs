VBScript Compatibility Library for Javascript
============================================

Microsoft has slowly being retiring support for VBScript. 
At this point VBScript is not supported on IE11.

So I tought. Well what happen if you have lots of VBScript and you need help on moving them to Javascript.

So I decided to create a small compatibility library to make the task less stressful.

Current Progress
---------------

At this point I have only created the BuiltIn Functions stubs with JScomments
My plan is to create a set of unit tests that take the VBScript input-output and validates equivalence.
But that will take some time. I will be updating any progress.
